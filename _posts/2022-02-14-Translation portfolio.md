# Academic article: Cold War 2.0

Input language: English | Output language: Chinese
--- | ---
The Cold War 2.0 embodies a highly distinctive concept of competition in the 21st century, yet its aftermaths may prove equally dangerous and impactful if no timely action is implemented. Civil casualty, encroachment on human rights, financial losses as well as social unrest have unfortunately been taking place due to the Chinese and Russian destabilisation of democratic space. For instance, the Chinese ruthless armed suppression of the dissident voice originating from Taiwan and Hongkong. Russia has equally committed outrageous humanitarian crimes over the years, notably the military intervention in Ukraine which culminated in the unlawful annexation of Crimea in 2014. Both China and Russia have also on repeated occasions initiated cyber aggression on western databases in order to illegally appropriate sensitive information and to advance their own ends. | 我们即将面临的是前所未有的竞争概念。若不悬崖勒马，第二次冷战对世界和平的杀伤力会是不可磨灭的。不幸的是，中俄双方屡屡挑战现代民主价值并侵犯人权，以致社会动荡，人心惶惶。近年来港台独立分子频繁遭受残暴的武力镇压，便是中方挑衅世界和平的最佳印证。另一边厢，俄罗斯也不断犯下令人发指的罪行。其中最令人诟病的是二零一四年对乌克兰的军事干预，最终以俄国非法吞并克里米亚落幕。为了一己之私，中俄两方更是多次对西方各国数据库发起网络侵略，企图通过非法途径获取关键信息。

1956年6月2日，颜本翰教授出生于东柏林的一个书香门第，双亲皆为知名科学家。本翰教授对多元文化与智力的初识，缘于幼年时期父亲被时任东德政府外放到维也纳任职科学家的任命。如此机缘，或许正预示着本翰教授有朝一日终将发奋挣脱铁幕，进而改写自身的命运。在父亲的悉心指导下，年幼而志远的本翰教授培养出了对化学的热爱。这份热忱日后支撑着本翰教授在著名的柏林洪堡大学不断地钻研化学，直到他将年满三十时获得教授职位为止。| On 2nd June 1956, Prof. Jens Bernhardt was born into an academic family in East Berlin with both parents being prominent scientists. Since early childhood, Prof. Bernhardt was introduced to diversity in terms of cultures and intellects following his father’s delegation to Vienna as a governmental chemist. Such exposure foreshadowed his determination to break free from the Iron Curtain and rewrite his destiny one day. Under the  guidance of his father, the young and ambitious Prof. Bernhardt developed a passion for chemistry, which he continually pursued at the prestigious Humboldt University of Berlin until he attained professorship just before the age of 30.

因为爱情
怎么会有沧桑
所以我们还是年轻的模样
因为爱情
在那个地方
依然还有人在那里游荡
人来人往 | Wegen der Liebe
leben wir im Frieden.
Deshalb bleiben wir halt wie wir waren.
Wegen der Liebe
bleiben wir einfach da.
Mit der Liebe wandern wir einfach so aufwärts und abwärts.
