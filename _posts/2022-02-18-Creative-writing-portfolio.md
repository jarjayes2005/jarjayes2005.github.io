# Poetry: A Star is Born

I shall die as the most rebellious star in the sky <br /> One that never conforms to cosmic norm of any kind <br /> Darkness may make my look less dazzling <br /> Yet it can never turn my spirit less blazing <br /> For I dare to love and I dare to leave <br /> For I dare to live and I dare to die

# Poetry: Calling

Step by step <br /> Total surrender before triumph in the end

Time after time <br /> Before you realise it all rhymes

Run and run <br /> I hope one day you will jump the gun

Please oh please <br /> Let it come and let it be

# Recipe: Beer risotto
**This recipe was written by myself several years ago when my German proficiency was still not as strong, and the grammar is therefore by no means flawless! I however decided to upload the original creation here to preserve authenticity :)**
