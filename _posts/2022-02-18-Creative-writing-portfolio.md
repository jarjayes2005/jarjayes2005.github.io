# Original poetry: A Star is Born

I shall die as the most rebellious star in the sky
One that never conforms to cosmic norm of any kind
Darkness may make my look less dazzling
Yet it can never turn my spirit less blazing
For I dare to love and I dare to leave
For I dare to live and I dare to die

# Original poetry: Calling

Step by step
Total surrender before triumph in the end

Time after time
Before you realise it all rhymes

Run and run
I hope one day you will jump the gun

Please oh please
Let it come and let it be
