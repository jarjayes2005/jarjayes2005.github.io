Thank you for visiting my page! Here is Shi Yi speaking, I am a multilingual polyglot originally from Malaysia and have been living in Europe since 2013.

In face of the technological predomination of our modern era, I as a humanistic scholar have always been striving to promote the cooperation instead of hierarchy between soft and hard sciences.

Having undergone years of both academic and professional trainings, I have established solid expertise especially in the following areas:
- **linguistic services:** _ _translation, transcription, proofreading, interpretation, creative writings e.g. poetry_ _ 
- **interpersonal skills:** _ _both oral and written communication, bolstered with intercultural awareness and sensibility_ _ 
- **administrative know-how:** _ _organisation, account/file management, database maintenance, project/task coordination_ _
