Thank you for visiting my page! Here is Shi Yi speaking, I am a multilingual polyglot originally from Malaysia and have been living in Europe since 2013.

In face of the technological predomination of our modern era, I as a humanistic scholar have always been striving to promote the cooperation instead of hierarchy between soft and hard sciences.

Having undergone years of both academic and professional trainings, I have established solid expertise especially in the following areas:
- linguistic services: translation, transcription, proofreading, interpretation
- communication: both oral and written, bolstered with intercultural awareness and sensibility
- administrative skills: organisation, account/file management, database maintenance, project/task coordination
