I envisage to transform the world in any positive sense through my very own presence as well as endeavours. 

In face of this modern world predominated by technological advancement, I as a humanistic scholar strive to promote the cooperation instead of hierarchy between soft and hard sciences.

Having undergone years of both academic and professional trainings, I have established solid expertise in the following areas:
- linguistic services: translation, transcription, proofreading, interpretation
- communication: both oral and written, bolstered with intercultural awareness and sensibility
- administrative skills: organisation, account/file management, database maintenance, project/task coordination
