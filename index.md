Thank you for visiting my page! Here is Shi Yi speaking, I am a polyglot originally from Malaysia and have been living in Europe since 2013.

In face of the technological predomination of our modern era, I as a humanistic scholar have always been striving to promote the cooperation instead of hierarchy between soft and hard sciences.

I am a holder of both [LLB Law](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2022/law/llb-law/) and [M.A. Intercultural Communication & European Studies](https://www.hs-fulda.de/en/studies/departments/social-and-cultural-sciences/future-students/study-programmes/intercultural-communication-and-european-studies-ma).
