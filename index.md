Thank you for visiting my page! Here is Shi Yi speaking, I am a polyglot originally from Malaysia and have been living in Europe since 2013.

In face of the technological predomination of our modern era, I as a humanistic scholar have always been striving to promote the cooperation instead of hierarchy between soft and hard sciences.

I am a holder of both [LLB Law](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2022/law/llb-law/) and [M.A. Intercultural Communication & European Studies](https://www.hs-fulda.de/en/studies/departments/social-and-cultural-sciences/future-students/study-programmes/intercultural-communication-and-european-studies-ma).

You can find my Upwork profile [here](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d22bd8700b7c2b9d). Unfortunately I lost access to an older account several years ago, which contained way more reviews than what is visible on this rather new one...

Over the years, I have established solid expertise especially in the following areas:
- **linguistic services:** translation, transcription, proofreading, interpretation, creative writings e.g. poetry
- **interpersonal skills:** both oral and written communication, bolstered with intercultural awareness and sensibility
- **administrative competence:** organisation, account/file management, database maintenance, project/task coordination
- **IT know-how:** Windows/Microsoft Office, macOS/iWork, Google Suite, Git/Github, Audacity, CAT tools e.g. Transcafe/Smartcat, Wordpress, Facebook Page
